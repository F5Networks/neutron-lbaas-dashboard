  To help users get the most from their BIG-IPs, F5 Networks extended its implementation
  of LBaaSv2 to add an Enhanced Service Definition (ESD) feature. With ESDs, you can 
  deploy OpenStack load balancers customized for specific applications.

  An ESD is a set of tags and values that define custom settings, typically one or more profiles, 
  policies, or iRules which are applied to a BIG-IP virtual server.
